# Rinocchi

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

I will be rewriting all the code so the current code will not get updates.

- Performance
   - [ ] Cache SQL queries
   - [ ] Use Redis
   - [ ] Cluster / Sharding
- Organization & Code
  - [ ] Better standardization of commits
  - [ ] Improve code readability (with comments, etcetera)
  - [ ] File organization
  - [ ] More readable configuration files with yaml
  - [ ] New Dockerfile
  - [ ] Use all features of new Discord API updates
  - [ ] Some more modular features (maybe a plugin system?)
  - [ ] API for communicating with clients via http
